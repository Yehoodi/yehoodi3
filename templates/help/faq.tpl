		<dd>              
               <p>Currently Yehoodi has six "Yehoodistrators" who do most of the heavy lifting and decision-making about the site and our other activities. 
			The Yehoodistrators are:</p>

		<dt>&raquo; What's new in Yehoodi 3.1?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>On January 2010, we launched Yehoodi 3.0 -- a bold leap forward in swing website technology. Yehoodi 3.0 enhanced all of the community aspects of the site, making it easier for everyone to post, rate, bookmark, and talk about the swing stuff that we all care about.  Yehoodi 3.1 takes that one step further with a dramatic new color scheme and design, several new social media and social network functions, and other enhancements that we think you will like, including:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li><strong>A revamped home page:</strong> Get a quick snapshot of what's happening all over the site, check out featured topics, and see who's online right now</li> 
                    <li><strong>A better Discussion area:</strong> We've redone the look of the browse section, so you can easily see who's talking about what</li>
                    <li><strong>A Badass Text Editor:</strong> Writing new posts and comments on the site never was easier or more powerful, allowing you to add HTML code, images, videos and music directly into your comment!</li>
                    <li><strong>Share with Your Networks:</strong> Put your location in your account settings, and we will show you swing events within a set distance from you (i.e. all upcoming events within a 30 minute drive from Boston, MA)</li> 
               </ul>

               <p>Lots of stuff on Yehoodi is available to you whether or not you <a href="/account/register">register</a> on our site.  
			You can read our listings, discussion and events, <a href="/search/">search</a> for things, and access our various media offerings. 
			But it's so much cooler to <a href="/account/register">register</a> for a number of reasons:</p> 
			<ul>
                    <li>Participate in our lively, silly and sometimes heated conversations</li>
                    <li>Have Yehoodi show you swing events that are near you </li>
                    <li>Bookmark your favorite stuff on our site so you can get to it later</li> 
                    <li>Exchange private messages with other Yehoodites! </li>
                    <li>Access to the "All Time" link on the discussion page to view ALL discussion topics dating back to the day Yehoodi.com started! </li>

		<dt>&raquo; Why Do I Get Logged Off Automatically?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>If you do not click the "Log me in automatically" box when you login, the site will only keep you logged in for a preset time. 
			This prevents misuse of your account by anyone else. To stay logged in check the box during login, this is not recommended if you access 
			the site from a shared computer, e.g. library, internet cafe, university cluster, etc. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a><p>

		<dt>&raquo; Dammit, I lost my password!</dt>

		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; I registered but cannot login! </dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Firstly, check your are entering the correct username and password.</p>
			<p>When you register, you will be sent an email with instructions on how to fully activate
			 your account on Yehoodi. One reason activation is used is to reduce the possibility of rouge users and spammers abusing the site anonymously. If you are sure
			  the email address you used is valid then contact us at <a href="mailto:support@yehoodi.com">support@yehoodi.com</a>. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
  		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; I registered in the past but cannot login any more?! </dt>
		<dd>
			<p>The most likely reasons for this are: you entered an incorrect username or password (check the email you were sent when you first registered), or the 
			Yehoodistrator has deleted your account for some reason. If it is the later case then perhaps you did not post anything? It is usual for sites to periodically 
			remove users who have not posted anything, so as to reduce the size of the database. Try <a href="/account/register">registering</a> again.

		<dt>&raquo; How to Add a Swing Event</dt>

               <p>Yehoodi is a great vehicle for getting other dancers interested in your event.  You can enter in the information about an event that either you are directly involved in or have detailed knowledge about.  Here's how:</p>
               <ul>
                    <li>Click on the <a href="/submit/">Add a Topic</a> tab (you need to be logged in to do this!) </li>

	<h2 class="faq" id="calendar">Calendar</h2>
	<dl class="faq">
		<dt>&raquo; So how does this calendar thing work?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>It's pretty simple. The basic navigation controls allow you to move forward, back and jump to "today" on the calendar. The Month view is for the entire month while the week view is a week-by-week glance. Some users like the week view since it limits the clutter of a full month.</p>
			<p>The different event types are coded in different colors. You can also limit the view to a single event type by clicking on the event type name in the control bar.</p>
			<p>If you move your mouse over any event, a tooltip will pop up with a little more detail about the event, including its full name, location, dates, event type, number of comments, votes and views.</p>
			<p>Clicking the event will take you to its details / comment thread. There is a "Back to Calendar" link that will get you back to where you left off on the calendar. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; Great. Now how do I find events for my trip to New York, NY? I live in Miami, FL.</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Easy. Click the "Events by Location" tab. Then enter "New York, NY" (or wherever you want to search) into the location text box and click "Show". The calendar will then fetch the events (within a 300 miles / 482 kilometers) of New York, NY. This search is stored in a cookie so you can return to it later. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; Do I have to be logged in to get events?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>No. Anyone can search for events, whether they are logged in or not. If you do have an account, you have the convenience of being able to set your "home location." But you can always search for any location you like. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; What is the difference between "Events Anywhere" and "Events by Location"?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Think of "Events Anywhere" as your national swing calendar. All swing exchanges, swing camp / workshops, and competition / workshops are listed here.</p>
			<p>"Events by Location" contains the above, plus local "Swing Dances" and "Performance &amp; Special Event" types. This is where the local schools, dances, shows, etc. can post their events that other users can easily search for. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo;  I want to submit an event that isn't exactly a venue for dancing, but it is totally swing related (i.e. a jazz night at a small club, a swing dance related theater based show). Can I submit that?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>Yes. The category "Performance &amp; Special Event" is created for that purpose. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; Why are the event types "Swing Dance" and "Performance &amp; Special Events" only available on the "Events By Location" tab? Why can't I see it on the "Events Anywhere" tab?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>"Swing Dance" and "Performance &amp; Special Events" are considered local events in our system so the calendar doesn't get overcrowded. Imagine one "Swing Dance" listed in every state in the US on every Thursday night. To include these on the "Anywhere" calender listings would create fifty events every week on the Thursday, never mind the fact that this data is not very helpful in the end (unless you own a teleportation device).</p>
			<p>This makes it very easy for someone to search for local swing dances based on the city and state where they live or will be visiting. <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
		</dd>
		<dt>&raquo; I entered my event as a Camp / Workshop but someone changed it to a Swing Dance. What gives?</dt>
		<dd>
			<p>This is usually because a Yehoodi moderator moved it to a more appropriate category.</p>
			<p>For example, if you are running a recurring dance/class, you should use the category "Swing Dance" as this will get your event on the local calendars of that area. "Camp / Workshop", "Exchange" and "Comp / Workshop" are for non-recurring (not weekly) events that have more of a national scope (i.e. Camp Jitterbug, Swing Out New Hampshire and Herrang Dance Camp). <a href="#div_header">Back to top</a></p>
