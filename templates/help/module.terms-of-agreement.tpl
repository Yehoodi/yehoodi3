<h2>Yehoodi Registration Agreement</h2>

<p>The text below states what our site agreement is in detail but we would like to emphasis our main rule: "no personal attacks." Play nice on our site: it's our sandbox, our rules.</p>

<h3>1. GENERAL RULES AND DEFINITIONS</h3>

<p>1.1 If you choose to use the Yehoodi.com service (the "Service"), you will be agreeing to abide by all of the terms and conditions of this Agreement between you and Yehoodi.com. </p>

<p>1.2 Yehoodi.com may change, add or remove portions of this Agreement at any time, but if it does so, it will post such changes on the Service, and/or send them to you via e-mail. </p>

<p>1.3     IF ANY OF THESE RULES OR ANY FUTURE CHANGES ARE UNACCEPTABLE TO YOU, YOU MAY CANCEL YOUR REGISTRATION BY SENDING E-MAIL TO: SUPPORT@YEHOODI.COM (SEE SECTION 9.1 REGARDING TERMINATION OF SERVICE). YOUR CONTINUED USE OF THE SERVICE NOW, OR FOLLOWING THE POSTING OF NOTICE OF ANY CHANGES IN THESE OPERATING RULES, WILL INDICATE ACCEPTANCE BY YOU OF SUCH RULES, CHANGES, OR MODIFICATIONS. </p>

<p>1.4 Yehoodi.com may change, suspend or discontinue any aspect of the Service at any time, including the availability of any Service feature, database, or content. Yehoodi.com may also impose limits on certain features and services or restrict your access to parts or all of the Service without notice or liability. </p>

<h3>2. CONTENT AND USER SUBMISSIONS </h3>

<p>2.1 The contents of the Yehoodi.com service are intended for your personal, noncommercial use. You shall abide by all copyright notices, information, or restrictions contained in any Content accessed through the Service (the "Content"). </p>

<p>2.2 You may download or copy the Content and other downloadable items displayed on the Service for personal use only, provided that you maintain all copyright and other notices contained therein. Copying or storing of any Content for other than personal use is expressly prohibited without prior written permission from Yehoodi.com. </p>

<h3>3. DISCUSSIONS AND POSTS</h3>

<p>3.1 You shall not upload to, distribute, or otherwise publish on the site any libelous, defamatory, obscene, pornographic, abusive, or otherwise illegal material. Do you collar this jive? </p>

<p>3.2     (a) Be courteous, be cool. You agree that you will not threaten or verbally abuse other site users, use defamatory language, or deliberately disrupt discussions with repetitive messages, meaningless messages or "spam," i.e., no "trolling." </p>

<p>3.3 (b) Use respectful language. Like any community, the site flourish only when our users feel welcome and safe. You agree not to use language that abuses or discriminates on the basis of race, religion, nationality, gender, sexual preference/orientation, dancing abilities/styles, satorial saviness, age, region, disability, etc. Hate speech of any kind is totally unhep and is grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service. </p>

<p>3.4 (c) Debate, but don't attack. We're a community full of opinions and preferences, swingers will always disagree. Yehoodi.com encourages active discussions and welcomes heated debate in our discussion areas. But personal attacks are a direct violation of this Agreement and are grounds for immediate and permanent suspension of access to all or part of the Service. </p>

<p>3.5 You are solely responsible for the content of your messages. However, while Yehoodi.com does not and cannot review every message posted by you on the Forums and is not responsible for the content of these messages, Yehoodi.com reserves the right to delete, move, or edit messages that it, in its sole discretion, deems abusive, defamatory, obscene, in violation of copyright or trademark laws, or otherwise unacceptable. Neener neener! </p>

<p>3.6 You acknowledge that any submissions you make to the Service (e.g., news items, event notices, discussion posts and replies) may be edited, removed, modified, published, transmitted, and displayed by Yehoodi.com and you waive any moral rights you may have in having the material altered or changed in a manner not agreeable to you. </p>

<p>3.7 The Yehoodi.com administrators reserve the right to reveal your identity (or whatever information we know about you) in the event of a complaint or legal action arising from any message posted by you. </p>

<h3>4. ACCESS AND AVAILABILITY OF SERVICE AND LINKS</h3>
