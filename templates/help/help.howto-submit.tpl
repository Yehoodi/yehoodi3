<h2>How to Add a Topic:</h2>
<ul>
     <li><strong>Don't feel like reading all this?</strong> Take a look at the help video for <a href="javascript:vidWindow1();">adding a topic</a> and this one for <a href="javascript:vidWindow2();">adding an event.</a>. (You should totally still read all this, though...)</li>
     <li><strong>Choose a Topic that most fits your subject.</strong> This will make it easier for other Yehoodites to find your post.</li>
     <li><strong>Choose a Category from the list that’s a good match for your overall message.</strong> For example, if you want to talk about general swing stuff, choose "Swing Talk" under "Lindy". If you have an event to announce, choose "Event" and then the appropriate category.</li>
     <li><strong>Enter your Title.</strong> This is the first thing the world will see for your new post. Try to keep it short but exciting. Yehoodi will try to find titles that are like yours, so you can avoid posting something that has already been posted.</li>
     <li><strong>Enter your Message.</strong> This is where the meat of your post goes. You can see a preview of what the finished post will look like at the bottom of this page. Provide details. Write clearly and simply. You can also use Markdown to enhance your post with text formatting, links to other websites and images.</li>
     <li><strong>Post your topic or save it for later editing.</strong> Posting sends your message to the world and saving it will drop the message into your Account Settings under "Drafts".</li>
     <li>If you are entering an Event, please read the <a href="{geturl controller='help' action='faq'}" >FAQ</a> for more info.</li>
</ul>
