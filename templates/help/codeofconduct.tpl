</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Yehoodi/Frim Fram is dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable Lindy Hop experience for everyone, regardless of gender expression, age, sexual orientation, ability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment or assault of event participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery in social situations is not appropriate for any event venue, including dances, workshops, competitions, Twitter, Facebook, and other online media. Participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the event without a refund at the discretion of the Frim Fram staff.</span>
</p>
<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">CODE OF CONDUCT IN DETAIL</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>No forms of harassment will be tolerated. The key to sexual harassment is that its reception is more important than the harasser&rsquo;s original intent. Harassment includes offensive verbal comments (related to gender expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion), sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of classes and dances, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>If a participant engages in harassing behavior, Frim Fram staff may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the event with no refund. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of staff immediately, using one of the methods above. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Frim Fram staff will be happy to help participants contact the Club 412 staff, or local law enforcement, provide escorting from the building or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the event. We value your attendance and your safety. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">BEING A RESPECTFUL DANCE EVENT ATTENDEE</span><span>&nbsp;</span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Please do not offer unsolicited advice to fellow dancers either in class or on the social dance floor. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Please use your full range of senses on the dance floor to avoid accidental collisions and injuries. It is every dancer&#39;s responsibility to be aware of their own and their partner&#39;s movement and position, as well as the movement and position of the dancers surrounding them, in order to avoid all forms of dangerous contact. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Please be respectful to both Frim Fram and Club 412 staff, even if you are experiencing a personal frustration. Without the goodwill of these individuals, a smoothly functioning event is impossible. </span>
</p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span>Finally, be aware of your own boundaries and physical needs.</span></p>

<p><a name="h.gjdgxs"></a><span style="font-weight: bold">PLEASE CONTACT SOMEONE IF YOU NEED HELP. BE SAFE, AND ENJOY FRIM FRAM!</span>
